OpenDSA-LTI Web Interfaces
==========================

OpenDSA and the LMS
-------------------

OpenDSA now works in conjunction with a Learning Management System
(LMS).
Initially, only |canvas_link| is supported, but we hope to support more
systems in the near future.
All tasks related to class roll management, creating assignments from
exercises, due dates, and tracking scores and progress are done using
the standard tools provided by the LMS.
