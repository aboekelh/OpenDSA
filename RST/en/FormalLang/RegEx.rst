Regular Expressions
===================

Regular Expressions
-------------------

Regular expressions are a way to specify a set of strings that define
a language.

There are three operators that can be used:

* :math:`+` union (or)
* :math:`\circ` concatenation (AND)
* :math:`*` star-closure (repeat 0 or more times)

.. TODO::

   Is this true?: The AND operator is not strictly necessary, in that it is
   possible to define all regular expressions without it.
   What did Susan mean by saying that AND can be omitted?

Example:

   :math:`(a + b)^* \circ a \circ (a + b)^* = (a + b)^*a(a + b)^*`

   .. note::

      Strings over :math:`\Sigma^*` that contain at least one
      :math:`a`.

   :math:`(aa)*`

   .. note::

      Strings with an even number of :math:`a` 's

**Definition:** Given :math:`\Sigma`,

#. :math:`\emptyset`, :math:`\lambda`, and :math:`a \in \Sigma` are R.E.

#. If :math:`r` and :math:`s` are R.E. then

   * :math:`r + s` is R.E.
   * :math:`r s` is R.E.
   * :math:`(r)` is R.E.
   * :math:`r^*` is R.E.

#. :math:`r` is a R.E iff it can be derived from (1) with a finite
   number of applications of (2).

**Definition:** :math:`L(r) =` language denoted by R.E. :math:`r`.

#. :math:`\emptyset`, :math:`\{\lambda\}`, and :math:`\{a \in \Sigma\}`
   are languages denoted by a R.E.

#. If :math:`r` and :math:`s` are R.E. then

   * :math:`L(r + s) = L(r) \cup L(s)`
   * :math:`L(r s) = L(r) \circ L(s)`
   * :math:`L((r)) = L(r)`
   * :math:`L((r)^*) = (L(r)^*)`


Precedence Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* :math:`*` highest
* :math:`\circ`
* :math:`+` lowest

Example: :math:`ab^* + c = (a(b)^*) + c`

Examples
~~~~~~~~

#. :math:`\Sigma = \{a,b\}`,
   :math:`\{w \in {\Sigma}^{*} \mid w`
   has an odd number of :math:`a` 's followed by an even number of
   :math:`b` 's :math:`\}`.

   :math:`(aa)^{*}a(bb)^{*}`



#. :math:`\Sigma=\{a,b\}`, :math:`\{w \in {\Sigma}^{*} \mid w` has no more than
   three :math:`a` 's and must end in :math:`ab\}`.

   :math:`b^{*}(ab^{*} + ab^{*}ab^{*} + \lambda)ab`

#. Regular expression for positive and negative integers

   :math:`0 + (- + \lambda)((1+2+\ldots +9)(0+1+2+\ldots +9)^{*})`

   What is acceptable, and not acceptable? 


Regular Expressions vs. Regular Languages
-----------------------------------------

.. note::

   Explain the picture NFA -> DFA -> min DFA, how do R.E. and NFA
   relate?

.. TODO::

   Show pictures of some R.E.s that are accepted by NFAs.

**Theorem:** Let :math:`r` be a R.E. Then :math:`\exists` NFA
:math:`M` such that :math:`L(M) = L(r)`.

**Proof:** By simple simulation/construction. (This is a standard
approach to proving such things!)

   :math:`\emptyset`

   .. note::

      Draw a picture of a NFA with start state and final state and no
      arcs. There is no way to get to the end state, so nothing is in
      the language. [Linz 3.1(a)]
      
   :math:`\{\lambda\}`

   .. note::

      Draw a picture of an NFA that accepts :math:`\lambda`.
      [Linz 3.1(b)]
         
   :math:`\{a\}`
         
   .. note::

      Draw a picture of an NFA that accepts :math:`a`. [Linz 3.1(c)]

   Suppose that :math:`r` and :math:`s` are R.E. (By induction...)
   That means that there is an NFA for :math:`r` and an NFA for
   :math:`s`.

      #. :math:`r + s`. Simply add a new start state and a new final
         state, each connected (in parallel) with :math:`\lambda`
         transitions to both :math:`r` and :math:`s`. [Linz 3.3]
      #. :math:`r \circ s`. Add new start state and new final state,
         and connect them with :math:`\lambda` transitions in series.
         [Linz 3.4]
      #. :math:`r^*`. Add new start and final states, along with
         :math:`\lambda` transitions that allow free movement between
         them all. [Linz 3.5]
    
**Example:** :math:`ab^* + c`

.. note::

   Do this in JFLAP, Ideally, show R.E -> NFA, then NFA -> DFA,
   then DFA -> min DFA.


**Theorem:** Let :math:`L` be regular. Then :math:`\exists` R.E. such
that :math:`L = L(r)`.

.. note::

   Probably most can quickly see that any R.E can be implemented as a
   NFA. It might not be so obvious that any NFA can be converted to a
   R.E.

   Proof Idea: remove states sucessively, generating equivalent 
   generalized transition graphs (GTG) until only two states are left 
   (one initial state and one final state). The transition between
   these states is a R.E that is equivalent to the original NFA.

**Definition:** A Generalized Transition Graph (GTG) is a transition
graph whose edges can be labeled with any regular expression.
Thus, it "generalizes" the standard transition graph. [See Linz 3.8]

**Definition:** A complete GTG is a complete graph, meaning that every
state has a transition to every other state.
Any GTG can be converted to a complete GTG by adding edges labeled
:math:`\emptyset` as needed.

.. TODO::

   What does a :math:`\emptyset` transition mean? It is definitely not
   the same thing as a :math:`\lambda` transition. Does it mean "Drop
   dead when you try that, it is not allowed?"

**Proof:**

:math:`L` is regular :math:`\Rightarrow \exists` NFA :math:`M` such
that :math:`L = L(M)`.

#. Assume :math:`M` has one final state, and :math:`q_0 \notin F`.

#. Convert :math:`M` to a complete GTG.

   Let :math:`r_{ij}` stand for the lable of the edge from :math:`q_i`
   to :math:`q_j`.

#. If the GTG has only two states, then it has this form:

   .. odsafig:: Images/nfatore1.png
      :width: 250
      :align: center
      :capalign: justify
      :figwidth: 90%
      :alt: nfatore1

   Add an arrow to the start state. Then, the corresponding regular
   expression is:

   :math:`r = (r^*_{ii}r_{ij}r^*_{jj}r_{ji})^*r^*_{ii}r_{ij}r^*_{jj}`

#. If the GTG has three states, then it must have the following form:

   .. odsafig:: Images/nfatore2.png
      :width: 250
      :align: center
      :capalign: justify
      :figwidth: 90%
      :alt: nfatore2

   In this case, make the following replacements:

   .. math::
      
      \begin{array}{lll}
      REPLACE & \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ & WITH \\ \hline
      r_{ii} && r_{ii}+r_{ik}r_{kk}^{*}r_{ki} \\
      r_{jj} && r_{jj}+r_{jk}r_{kk}^{*}r_{kj} \\
      r_{ij} && r_{ij}+r_{ik}r_{kk}^{*}r_{kj} \\
      r_{ji} && $r_{ji}+r_{jk}r_{kk}^{*}r_{ki} \\
      \end{array}

   After these replacements, remove state :math:`q_k` and its edges.

#. If the GTG has four or more states, pick any state :math:`q_k` that
   is not the start or the final state.
   It will be removed.
   For all :math:`o \neq k, p \neq k`, replace :math:`r_{op}` with
   :math:`r_{op} + r_{ok}r^*_{kk}r_{kp}`.

   When done, remove :math:`q_k` and all its edges.
   Continue eliminating states until only two states are left.
   Finish with step (3).

#. In each step, we can simplify regular expressions :math:`r` and
   :math:`s` with any of these rules that apply:

   .. math::
      
      \begin{array}{l}
      r + r = r \\
      s + r{}^{*}s = r{}^{*}s\\
      r + \emptyset = r\\
      r\emptyset = \emptyset\\
      \emptyset^{*} = \{\lambda\}\\
      r\lambda = r\\
      (\lambda + r)^{*} = r^{*}\\
      (\lambda + r)r^{*} = r^{*}\\
      \end{array}

   And similar rules.

.. note::

   **Example:** DO WITH JFLAP. Then add another state :math:`q_3` and
   add arcs :math:`d(q1,a) = q3, \quad d(q3,a) = q1, \quad d(q3,b) = q2`. 

   Examples are in ``~rodger/cl/cps140/jflapex/chap3dfatore1.jff`` and
   ``chap3dfatore2.jff``.

.. odsafig:: Images/stnfatore2s.png
   :width: 400
   :align: center
   :capalign: justify
   :figwidth: 90%
   :alt: stnfatore2s

We have now demonstrated that R.E. is equivalent (meaning, goes both
directions) to DFA.
